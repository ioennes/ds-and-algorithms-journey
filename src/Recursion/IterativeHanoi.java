// The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that consists of three rods and a set
// of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with
// the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at
// the top, thus making a cone shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the
// entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
//
// Only one disk can be moved at a time.
// Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
// No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
